    <p>
      The first option of <em>Adapter.fix</em> method is <em>scrollPosition</em>.
      It allows to change the position of the viewport's scrollbar programmatically.
      It is used in the lib tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of <em>scrollPosition</em> should be an integer or Infinity.
      Negative value would be treated as zero.
      Despite the browsers have no agreement on how to deal with
      setting <em>scrollTop</em>/<em>scrollLeft</em> properties
      into <em>+/-Infinity</em>, the <em>uiScroll</em> treats them as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        scroll to the beginning of the viewport if <em>-Infinity</em>,
        (the value will be set to <em>0</em>)
      </li>
      <li>
        scroll to the end of the viewport if <em>Infinity</em>
        (scroll position will be set into the viewport's
        <em>scrollHeight</em> or <em>scrollWidth</em> value)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

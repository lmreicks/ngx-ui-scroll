  <div description>
    <p>
      When there is a lack of items in the viewport, the <em>uiScroll</em> sets
      the height of the forward padding element to some value enough to fill the viewport.
      This is default behavior, and this can be changed with the help of <em>inverse</em> setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <em>inverse</em> setting is set to <em>true</em>,
      the backward padding element will have a priority over the forward one,
      and it will be stretched if there are not enough items in the viewport.
    </p>

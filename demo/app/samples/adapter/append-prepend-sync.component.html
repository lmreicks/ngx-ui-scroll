      Both <em>Adapter.append</em> and <em>Adapter.prepend</em> methods have second argument
      which is optional and which allows to prevent rendering of new items in the Viewport when
      the end of the dataset (if we are speaking of <em>append</em>) or
      beginning of the dataset (<em>prepend</em> case) is not reached.
      The <em>append</em> second argument is called <em>eof</em> (end-of-file),
      the <em>prepend</em> second argument is called <em>bof</em> (begin-of-file).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's discuss <em>Adapter.prepend(items, bof)</em> case.
      So if <em>bof</em> is set to <em>true</em> and the beginning of the dataset is reached
      (and no more items can be fetched in backward direction), then
      new items will be injected immediately.
      Otherwise new items will not appear, they will be virtualized:
      viewport backward padding element size will be increased in accordance with
      the number of new items multiplied by the average item size.
      The same is true for <em>Adapter.append(items, eof)</em>
      adjusted for forward direction and forward padding element.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this demo we want the datasource to be consistent with the dataset changes made during append/prepend.
      For this purpose a limited dataset is initialized on the constructor and
      <em>Datasource.get</em> takes items by <em>id</em>, not by index. We can't rely on index because
      we are going to update our dataset per each <em>doAppend</em> / <em>doPrepend</em> calls
      destructively by <em>unshift</em> and <em>push</em>.
      This will guarantee stable data flow from the App component to the <em>uiScroll</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practical use of this feature could be versatile, but
      the main idea is to synchronize, say, remote dataset changes with
      the <em>uiScroll</em> state visible to the end user.

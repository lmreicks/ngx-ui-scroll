      <em>Adapter.remove</em> method allows to remove items
      from current <em>uiScroll</em> buffer. This method accepts 1 argument
      which is a predicate function applying to each item in the current buffer.
      If the return value is true, the item will be removed.
      In this demo we have pretty simple predicate:
    </p>
    <pre>{{predicateDescription}}</pre>
    <p>
      Since the argument of the predicate has <em>ItemAdapter</em> type,
      the <em>data</em> contains id-text objects defined at the component level.
      The argument of <em>doRemove</em> method comes from the template
      as the <em>id</em> of the item the user clicked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very important thing is to synchronize our datasource with the changes
      we are making over the <em>uiScroll</em> buffer via <em>Adapter.remove</em>.
      Generally this is the App component responsibility,
      and in this demo it happens via <em>doRemoveDatasource(id)</em> method.
      It removes item with given <em>id</em> from the initial dataset,
      and decrements <em>id</em> of all items whose ids are greater than the given one.
    </p>
  </div>
